<p style="padding-top:50px;">My Lords, what's gucci?  This will probably be the first power rankings that will appear on the live site, as I plan on launching some time this offseason.  It's currently 1/27, about a week and a half before the Panthers and the Broncos square off in the finale.  And let me tell you - I couldn't be less excited for this one.  Seeing as the Seahawks aren't playing, I care about as much about this game as I do about the new gay porn site coming out - which is not a lot, cuz I'm not gay.  Just made that up too, I hope you searched for it.  Anyways, the only stake I have in this game is seeing Cam Newton wipe that stupid grin off his face and the whole Panthers team lose the big one.  There was big news today about Cam Newton defending his celebrating on the field, and the fact that maybe he's treated unfairly because he's a black quarterback, and let me tell you, there is some merit to that, but nevertheless I hate seeing the guy (and his team) celebrate after every god damn play.  Maybe the key is to keep them out of the end zone if you don't want to see it, but I'm entitled to hating his guts, and he's entitled to doing what he does.  No one is wrong.</p>

<p>In any event, I'll keep these as concise as possible, since you probably have better things to do than read me rambling about not being gay, so here they are - your 2015 final power rankings:</p>

<p><b>1) Seattle Seahawks</b></p>

<p>Big surprise, I know.  Not at all biased either.  If you read the home page of this website, you'll see that I clearly state that my intentions for this site are to provide data visualizations for all teams, and that my goal is to present a visual argument for the Seahawks being the best team in the NFL.  At the stage I'm at as of now, I've merely provided a few visualizations for each team, which don't show anything in the way of my mission statement, but in the coming weeks will actively seek those charts and graphs that will prove this point, as well as this #1 ranking.  In doing so, you'll come away with one of two things - either the Seahawks are indeed the best team in the NFL, or data can be manipulated in any way you want to show something.  So either way, you'll learn something of value.  Hawks are the best though, and outplayed the Panthers a week and a half ago (over 100 more yards than them).</p>

<p><b>2) Carolina Panthers</b></p>

<p>Man these guys are annoying.  Has anyone every pissed you off more than Cam Newton does when he scores a TD?  It just gets to the core of you, and starts eating you out from inside like Future and Ciara while Russ watches.  Nothing is more painful, even the Kaepernick bicep kiss wasn't as bad cuz you knew he was just a douche bag and wasn't actually good, so you just brushed it off.  With this though, he kinda looks a little unstoppable, and the fact that he knows it makes it 1000x worse.  I hope they lose, and I hope we get back to Carolina, or they come here, in the playoffs next year so we can punish Cam, the post-game dab picture crew, and Shaq Thompson, the former Washington Husky, who told Seattle Seahawks fans to go fuck themselves (literally) after they beat us.  God I hate these guys.  I'll give them their proper respect for being 17-1 though.</p>








<p><b>3) New Orleans Saints</b></p>

<p>The Saints are also a solid team, and I'm just waiting for a Broncos slip up so I can move them ahead, because frankly, I hate the Broncos for stealing our thunder in the eyes of the national media. What can you do about it though when you have identical records but they have the storied Peyton Manning at Q? Nothing, I guess. I just hope we don't play them in the Bowl, not because I don't think we're the better team, but because it'll be the Peyton Manning Hall of Fame Show, just like when Jerome Bettis played us in the SB. We won that game, and I wholeheartedly believe that. The refs truly were biased that game. They had the balls to com out and say they messed up, 2 years later though. So I'm not that mad *completely fucking kidding*.</p>

<p><b>4) Carolina Panthers</b></p>

<p>Like I said last week, they're solid. I'm not on the bandwagon, I'm just sticking to my original argument - that they're pretty good. They won't beat the Saints at NO, however, but they have a decent chance of beating them at home; for this reason they'll need some help from the Hawks in a couple weeks on Monday Night if they'd like to win the division. That would even the 2 at 3 losses each, with head to head being 1-1, so I don't know what comes next - division record? Whatever the case, neither team will beat the Seahawks at Century Link in the playoffs, so it doesn't really matter. Just kind of an interesting topic to think about with no real world consequences.</p>

<p><b>5) New England Patriots</b></p>

<p>Can't argue with the formula, these guys are good every year. With 2 losses, they have only 1 more loss than the Hawks this year, which is pretty unbelievable when you think about it. I think they'll shit on the Chiefs in the playoffs, and you'll see them in the title game against the Broncos. Either way, I smell bias against the Hawks.</p>

<p><b>6) San Francisco 49ers</b></p>

<p>They lost, sure, and it was at home, but let's not lose our heads about this - it was close. Trust me I'm happy they got their 3rd loss, but they're still a quality football team. They'll be a wildcard, and they'll cause some havoc just like the team they just lost to, but in the end they won't go into New Orleans or Seattle and pull out a W.</p>

<p><b>7) Kansas City Chiefs</b></p>

<p>Damn I'm buzzed right now - just threw in a pouch. I have nothing new to bring to the table about these guys, other than the fact they're giving up 5.0 yards per carry on the run, 2nd worst in the NFL, which spells trouble for them were they to play the Seahawks in the Super Bowl. I'm sure Marshawn is just licking his grill over that one, especially since we'd have our O Line healthy for that plus the addition of an MVP-type player in Percy. Another interesting factoid - they're fans are total losers. This troll my buddy and writer for elitedaily.com Tony Michaels is friends with on Facebook posted some meme about how it's "cute that your ankle hurts Peyton, but you play the Chiefs next" completely made a fool of himself behind a screen by saying "they've had the noise record for at least a couple years now", amongst other slanderous and untrue statements, like how we're going to burn to the ground once we sign Russell to a bigger contract after this season. The guy is a fool, and defriended Tony before me and my boys could humiliate him. At least he's wise in that regard.</p>

<p><b>8) Detroit Lions</b></p>

<p>A solid win against the Bears gives these guys my #8 spot on this week's list, and I think they'll continue to play in close ball game the rest of the year and maybe do some damage the rest of the year. Not scared of then though.</p>

<p><b>9) Indianapolis Colts</b></p>

<p>Man they got beat up by the Rams last week, proving my point that they're not that good. Just goes to show you how right I always am, and how wrong ESPN was for giving them the #1 overall spot a few weeks ago. They'll be alright, and win their shitty division, but I think this year and the next decade will prove how right I am about Russell being the better quarterback. Don't believe me? Look at my track record, and tell me I'm wrong.</p>

<p><b>10) Cincinnati Bengals</b></p>

<p>Why did they move up after losing? Because the alternatives are even worse. The Bears lost, and the Packers don't have a competent QB, so I gotta out them here. Trust me, I'm completely unimpressed by their track record this season, but I needed to put SOMEONE here. I think they'll churn out a solid season the rest of the way, and quietly win the AFC North, but man, they're not doing shit in the playoffs.</p>
